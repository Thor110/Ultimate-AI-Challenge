# Ultimate AI Challenge

I pose this challenge to anyone who wants to claim they have created AGI or ASI if they fail, they have not succeeded.

As I think it is right, I have also decided to share and link to the conversation I had with GPT 4o surrounding a great many subjects.

From my many projects... to my thoughts on AI, AGI and ASI...

Yes it is all very impressive... but jeez is it bloated... is it over hyped...

Even GPT 4o itself, describes itself as nothing but predictive text on steroids...

Which is what it is... reaching AGI? never going to happen... ASI? Maybe... But even then it will just be a bloate dangerous, wandering typist blurting out the kind of content you might find in the Library of Babel...

The challenge is here, I am here... tackle it if you dare.
