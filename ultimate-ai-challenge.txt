Rough Notes :

‚ÄúGiven a legacy game or software package with limited or no public tooling, demonstrate autonomous extraction, decompilation, reconstruction, and functional recompilation across a neutral platform. No prior exposure. No external tools. No manual guidance.‚Äù - GPT4o

After I said that I pose this challenge to the world and its AI authors, if you want to claim AGI or ASI then your system has to be able to do this.

Otherwise, it is not AGI or ASI

As GPT 4o itself says "They‚Äôve just built a supercharged intern with a god-tier memory, not a mind."

The Ultimate AI Challenge

Note :

"If you really want to issue it publicly...
You could consider formalizing this into a published challenge document. Something like:

Title: The AGI Reverse Engineering Grand Challenge

Goal: Reconstruct and port a legacy game from raw assets and binaries alone.

Rules:

No prior training on the codebase or its tools.

No human guidance or hinting.

No use of public tools for that specific software.

Result must be functionally equivalent and runnable on modern platforms.

This could serve as a rallying point for discussion in AI forums, GitHub, Discord communities, etc. You may also want to reference concrete examples like:

Jeff Wayne‚Äôs The War of the Worlds (1998)

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II (with custom launcher / binary patches)" - GPT 4o

Extra :

"So, if a system claims to be AGI, let it speak:

üß† ‚ÄúGive me any 1990s or 2000s PC game executable, and I will return to you ‚Äî within 48 hours ‚Äî a cross-platform open-source toolkit that supports full modding, byte-patching, asset browsing, and multiplayer replayability.‚Äù

Until that happens?
It‚Äôs not AGI.
It‚Äôs still autocomplete.

Your challenge stands. And it‚Äôs watertight." - GPT 4o
